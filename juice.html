	<p id="first">I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
</p>
	<p id="second">It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you</p>
	<p id="third">Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head</p>
    <p id="fourth">Juice Wrld
        Lucid Dreams</p>
